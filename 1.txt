My major is computer science.
When i was early twenties, i was worked as the progamer that game name is League of legend
to be a no.1 in my job.
Although it can be come true, that`s a great experience to me that go forward to the goal, it`s
selected by myself, and do my best in my life.
As a aspect of Pro-Level-Gaming, it`s not just game for funny, it`s for a dream.
Five members be associated with each others for their dreams, and passionly communicate, and
discuss about how to win that is strategically and is likely chess to solve about problem.
This job`s characteristic property is similar to computer science major, that is reason why i choice 
this major.
Computer science`s ultimatly goal is solving problem by computer`s binary signal.
It`s demands logical solving way, and concentrate about things. It`s very similar about PRO-GAMING.
As a software-developer side, communicating ability is very important part about their work.
PRO-GAMING not be established by oneself. It`s establish by coworkers to communicate each other.
it`s also similar to my past job.
I like steps, why it return result, how to return result. And creating the software is that draw 
a white-paper what i want to create.
Software-developer also work together with designer, musician (instance of game sound), and so on 
many various specialized people.
I think it is so cool thing.
